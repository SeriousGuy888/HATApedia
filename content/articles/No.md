# History

## Tobytopia Era
Toby and Anna were there and they killed each other a bunch of times (for fun; recreational murder).

Also """""[[Remy|someone]]""""" placed a sign that said "Toby is a stinky poo" in Tobytopia. This was reportedly because this """""someone""""" thought that [[Toby]] and [[Anna]] were getting too chummy.

This era is also when No got its name — when [[Billzoshoom]] requested that Toby name his land and was met with the answer of "No". Billzo thought this was an awfully strange name for a forest, but thought nothing of it, and labelled this place as No on the first map.
