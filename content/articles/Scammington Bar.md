# History

## Construction
The Scammington Bar is a bar built by [[Arvi]] in [[Scammington]] after negotiating with [[Remy]] for a building permit and a plot of land on which to build it<sup>[exact dates needed]</sup>.

## Operation
The Scammington Bar was known to be a gathering center for residents of Scammington, with prominent characters such as [[Remy]], [[Arvi]], [[Birch Nuke]], [[William Scamsworth]], and [[The Voices]] being regulars at the Bar.

## Destruction
The Bar was burned down by [[Arvi]] on 2023-04-13 while [[Remy]] was at school. Arvi had previously threatened to do this, and had indeed gone through with his threats.

Arvi's reasoning for doing so is somewhat unclear. The most likely explanation is that he was hypernatremic about having his [[Remyan citizenship]] revoked and resolved to burn down the Bar in retalliation.

However, Arvi also later asserted that he burned the bar simply because he "dint<sup>[sic]</sup> want it to be there any more".

> I want to make an announcement about the bar. I didn't want it to be there anymore, so I burnt it. I'm sorry that I almost killed the citizens. I was just trying to destroy my build. I am deeply sorry. Thank you. And about the lava, I put it so I can burn the place, not to kill anyone, Remy. That's all. You can have my land as I am no longer a citizen. You can do whatever you want with it. Thank you.

The legality of Arvi's actions have been the subject of scrutinty.

# Arvi's Bunker
The Scammington Bar has a nuclear fallout bunker located deep below it built by Arvi. There was a somewhat sneaky mechanism to enter the bunker before the Bar was burned down.
