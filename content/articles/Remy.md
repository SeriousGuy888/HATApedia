## (2023-01-22 to 2023-01-22): Interim Dictator of Tobytopia

### Catalyst
The reason that Toby was perceived as missing was that Toby had slipped away and abandoned Remy during their date in Billzoplace. Remy was reportedly planning to kidnap Toby after their date was finished, but was unsuccessful as Toby noticed the red flags and escaped before this could happen.

### Inauguration
RemyHemy gave an awesome speech on top of the speech platform in [[New Mangrovia]], announcing that [[Toby]] was missing.

Although he did promise that the [[Remy Republic]] would assemble a search party for a fullscale manhunt, Remy also invoked the [[Good Neighbour Policy]] which he totally made up right then and there and was able to declare himself to be the new interim leader of [[Tobytopia]].

He then sailed to [[Lilypad Pond]], where he was unable to find any existent government buildings to govern the country from. Remy then decided to construct a new government building in the area and renamed it to [[Propagule Palace]] in preparation for his inaugural address.

> Tobytopia! This is where I shall rule over you. Don't worry; we will find Toby. In the meantime, let's end one of your cris[e]s. As the leader of Tobytopia, we recognise Remyan Mangrovia to be a Remyan province and will no longer lay claim to the land. We will also be prepared to sign a treaty solidifying Remyan rule over Remyan Mangrovia.

### Resolution of the Remyan Mangrovia Dispute
During his short term as the leader of Tobytopia and as his first act as interim dictator, Remy declared that Tobytopia would officially renounce all territorial claims to [[New Mangrovia|Remyan Mangrovia]] and recognise it as a part of the Remy Republic.

RemyHemy, interim dictator of Tobytopia, also announced his intentions to sign a treaty with RemyHemy, Glorious Leader of the Remy Republic to make this recognition official.

This treaty never ended up materialising, as Remy was deposed from his position as the interim dictator before it could be drafted. It is also unclear whether the actions taken by Remy as the interim dictator were legal or legitimate, and the legality of his retraction of Tobytopian claims to Remyan Mangrovia are the subject of heated debate.

### Deposition

In a plot twist that nobody had expected, [[Toby|Toby from Tobytopia]] was, in fact, not dead. Toby made a triumphant return, landing atop the new government building in Propagule Palace. For "impersonating the Tobytopian Supreme Leader", Toby sentenced Remy to lifelong exile from the Tobytopian [[Swamp of Secrets]].

Upon his return to Remyan territory, the Glorious Leader addressed the people of the Remy Republic regarding his removal from power in Tobytopia. Atop the speech platform in Remyan Mangrovia, Remy gave the speech. In retalliation for Toby exiling Remy, forbidding him from entering the Swamp of Secrets, Remy exiled Toby from all Remy Republic territories. He also charged Toby with treason for kidnapping, enslaving, and torturing Remy earlier that day and with grand theft music for stealing a music disc from the [[Scammington Bar]]. Toby was also stripped of his Remy Republic citizenship as punishment.

### Legitimacy
It is unclear whether Remy's term as leader of Tobytopia was legitimate. Some say that it is a valid use of the [[Good Neighbour Policy]], but others still decry his actions as an illegal usurpation.

Remy's political decisions are also called into question by this issue of legitimacy. It is worth noting that Toby made no attempt to repeal any of Remy's decisions after he successfully regained control.
