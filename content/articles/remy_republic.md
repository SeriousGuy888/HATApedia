# Diplomacy

## Treaty of No (2022)
The *Treaty of No (2022)* is a treaty signed on 2022-12-25 between the Remy Republic and [Billzoplace](./billzoplace).
As this was during Remy's absence, it was Remyforg who represented the Remy Republic.

The treaty stipulates that Billzoplace would be allowed to export wheat from the Remy Republic
in exchange for Billzoplace funding the expansion of the Remy Republic's wheat fields.

## Treaty of No (2023)
The *Treaty of No (2023)* was a followup to the first Treaty of No. This treaty allowed the Remy Republic
free access to Billzoshoom's slime farm beneath the newly constructed oil rig.

The access was free because the previous Treaty of No already authorised Billzoplace free access to the Remyan
wheat from the wheat fields in No. This treaty effectively added to the previous agreement, making it
a wheat-for-slime trade agreement between the Remy Republic and the Billzoplace City State.

# The Great Mangrove War

The Great Mangrove War was a conflict between the Remy Republic and [Tobytopia](./tobytopia).
The disagreement was over which nation should have sovereignty over New Mangrovia
(then referred to by Remy as Remyan Mangrovia).

After Holden and Toby came to Forgsville and tried to burn down Remy's house,
Remy retalliated by burning down a large portion of the Swamp of Secrets in Tobytopia.
This crisis boiled over into an epique duel between Remy and Holden, which Remy would
win 2 to 1.

*The recording of the crisis and the duel is available [here](https://youtu.be/pXPVKZaFRZI).*

As a result of the Remyan victory, Remy and Holden came to the following agreement.
- Remy gets to own Remyan Mangrovia
- Remyan Mangrovia will be renamed to New Mangrovia
- Holden gets the title of Founder of New Mangrovia
- Holden gets to cleanup the mess from the crisis

Toby would later allude to not recognising this settlement between Remy and Holden,
saying that he might just invade and retake the territory for Tobytopia again. However,
Toby never acted on these threats, and New Mangrovia remains a Remyan territory.

# The Border Disorder
> Mr Tobachov, tear down that wall!

As the Glorious Leader, Remy, spoke these immortal words, the HATA worldborder
trembled in fear and retreated outwards.

## Western Hawainot Offensive
![Map of the Remyan advance into Western Hawainot](/images/articles/western_hawainot_offensive.png)

The Remy Republic initiated a military operation led by General Fletcher Quadratic
and swiftly invaded the western islands of the Hawainot Archipelago, collecting
jungle wood and cocoa beans so that he can finally begin producing his pogstries.

The military operation unfortunately was in fact very rushed in its planning and
the logistics were not well prepared for. The food shipments did not arrive and
Remy was forced to live off the land for the duration of the operation.

## Acquisition of Southern No
After planting his flag in Western Hawainot and acquiring his so coveted cocoa beans,
Remy also claimed Southern No. This is an area of land that was originally labelled as
being part of No on the first worldmap released, but tragically, in reality, lay outside
the confines of the 1000 block worldborder.

Toby from Tobytopia had threatened to claim Southern No before Remy could during the
days leading up to the Border Disorder, but these threats did not come to fruition.

## Jungle Island Incident
![Map of disputed jungle island](/images/articles/jungle_island_incident.png)

Remy had a dispute with Tobytopia over an island of sparse jungle to the west of Hawainot.
Remy had previously intended to claim this island, but had forgotten to do so in the commotion
of the Border Disorder. This island had a waterfall, and Remy had intended to turn the
island into a top tier resort due to its very unique and beautiful terrain.

Unfortunately for the Glorious Leader, Toby from Tobytopia found the island and claimed it
before Remy could do so. Toby planted the Tobytopian banner upon the northern side of the
island, cementing his claim before Remy could get there with his own banners.

Remy attempted an amphibious assault on the island, arriving in his oak boat. Unfortunately,
the Remyan military forces under General Fletcher Quadratic were tied down doing paperwork
after the Western Hawainot offensive. This meant that the Remyan invasion force was extremely
understaffed, with only the Glorious Leader himself participating in the invasion.

The invasion was repulsed by the defending Tobytopian forces. The Glorious Leader then made
a glorious retreat back to Hawainot after his glorious defeat on the jungle island.

## Claiming of the Jungle Mainland
After the glorious defeat on the jungle island, and on the suggestion of Toby, Remy rowed
his boat westward again, and claimed the coastline of the large landmass further to the west
of the jungle island. This landmass also had a large area of sparse jungle on it.
