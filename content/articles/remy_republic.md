# Relations With Billzoplace

## Treaty of No (2022)
The *Treaty of No (2022)* is a treaty signed on 2022-12-25 between the Remy Republic and [Billzoplace](./billzoplace).
As this was during Remy's absence, it was Remyforg who represented the Remy Republic.

The treaty stipulates that Billzoplace would be allowed to export wheat from the Remy Republic
in exchange for Billzoplace funding the expansion of the Remy Republic's wheat fields.

## Treaty of No (2023)

# The Great Mangrove War

The Great Mangrove War was a conflict between the Remy Republic and [Tobytopia](./tobytopia).
The disagreement was over which nation should have sovereignty over New Mangrovia
(then referred to by Remy as Remyan Mangrovia).

After Holden and Toby came to Forgsville and tried to burn down Remy's house,
Remy retalliated by burning down a large portion of the Swamp of Secrets in Tobytopia.
This crisis boiled over into an epique duel between Remy and Holden, which Remy would
win 2 to 1.

*The recording of the crisis and the duel is available [here](https://youtu.be/pXPVKZaFRZI).*

As a result of the Remyan victory, Remy and Holden came to the following agreement.
- Remy gets to own Remyan Mangrovia
- Remyan Mangrovia will be renamed to New Mangrovia
- Holden gets the title of Founder of New Mangrovia
- Holden gets to cleanup the mess from the crisis

Toby would later allude to not recognising this settlement between Remy and Holden,
saying that he might just invade and retake the territory for Tobytopia again. However,
Toby never acted on these threats, and New Mangrovia remains a Remyan territory.

# The Border Disorder
> Mr Tobachov, tear down that wall!

As the Glorious Leader, Remy, spoke these immortal words, the HATA worldborder
trembled in fear and retreated outwards.

## Western Hawainot Offensive

The Remy Republic initiated a military operation led by General Fletcher Quadratic
and swiftly invaded the western islands of the Hawainot Archipelago, collecting
jungle wood and cocoa beans so that he can finally begin producing his pogstries.

The military operation unfortunately was in fact very rushed in its planning and
the logistics were not well prepared for. The food shipments did not arrive and
Remy was forced to live off the land for the duration of the operation.
