# Territorial Disputes

## New Mangrovia
An area of mangrove trees planted by [Holden](./holden) in what used to be the savanna.
This area was at some point claimed by Remy, but this claim was disputed by Toby and
Holden since Holden, a Tobytopian, planted the trees.

When the conflict was resolved, it was agreed that the Remy Republic would own the area,
but Holden would be awarded with the title of Founder of New Mangrovia.

## Unnamed Jungle Island
This island, which is currently under Tobytopian sovereignty, was once part of a
dispute with Remy. Remy had intended to claim this island, but forgotten, and Toby
decided to claim it first.
