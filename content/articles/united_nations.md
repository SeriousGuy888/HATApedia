# Inception

The United Nations was an idea conceived by Remy, the Glorious Leader of the
Remy Republic, apparently based on something similar from a so-called "dream
world" called """""""CheezSurvNations""""""".

Remy came up with this idea after Arvi tried to sell him some real estate that
Arvi had built near spawn.

# Headquarters

The United Nations is headquartered to the northeast of Spawn, in the oak and
cobblestone building built by architect Arvi.

After buying the building from Arvi for the price of a building permit for a
bar in Scammington, Remy renovated the interior of the building to be fit to
host the United Nations.

Remy added chairs and a table, as well as ladders to get up and down.
