*See also: [[remyan_election_shooting|Hawainot Shooting on Remyan Election Night]]*

![[First_Parliament_of_the_Remy_Republic.png|Result of the election: Remy gets another term as Glorious Leader, SBP wins both houses of parliament]]
The election for the Villager Council occurred and concluded on 2023-02-16.

The election for the Duck Nest occurred on 2023-02-16, although a second vote for the Duck Nest continued until 21:00 on the following day, 2023-02-17.

### Duck Nest
The following are the candidates who ran in the first Remy Republic election for seats in the Duck Nest. The Slime Ball Party was able to achieve a full sweep of a victory in the election, at least in the Duck Nest.

|                   |        Slime Ball Party (SBP)         | Magma Cream Party (MCP) | Bloc Nobecois (BNQ) |
| -----------------:|:-------------------------------------:|:-----------------------:|:-------------------:|
|    **Forgsville** |            [[Remyforg]] üèÜ            |     Mike MacWebster     |                     |
|   **Scammington** |           Doug Shimadome üèÜ           |   William Scamsworth    |                     |
|            **No** |          Huck Finnisiter üèÜ           |      Toby Tontory       |   Gerry Flexagon    |
|      **Hawainot** | Glorious Leader [[Remy\|RemyHemy]] üèÜ |        Jose III         |                     |
| **New Mangrovia** |           John Nevilory üèÜ            |         Jose II         |                     |

It is worth noting that the vote was originally undecided, with the vote counts of Forgsville, New Mangrovia, and Hawainot all being tied at exactly 8 votes for the SBP and MCP each. As a result, a second vote was called a day later, and as [[Toby]] and [[Arvi]] were not able to participate in this vote<sup>[verification needed]</sup>, the SBP was able to take the victory.

### Villager Council
The Slime Ball Party also won a majority in the Villager Council, although it was not a full sweep, unlike the Duck Nest. The final vote **percentages** for the Villager Council were as follows:
| Province/Territory    | SBP   | MCP  | BNQ  | IND  |
| :-------------------- | :---- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Hawainot              | 95 üèÜ  | 5    |      |      |

## Treaty of No (2023)
*Main article: [[Treaty of No (2023)]]*

A followup to the first [[Treaty of No (2022)]].

## Remy Sea Trade Bloc Agreement
*Main article: [[Remy Sea Trade Bloc Agreement]]*

## Treaty of Neville
*Main article: [[Treaty of Neville]]*

This was an investment and trade agreement signed between the [[Remy Republic]] and [[Neville]].

# The Great Mangrove War

The Great Mangrove War was a conflict between the Remy Republic and [[Tobytopia]].
The disagreement was over which nation should have sovereignty over New Mangrovia
(then referred to by Remy as Remyan Mangrovia).

After Holden and Toby came to Forgsville and tried to burn down Remy's house,
Remy retalliated by burning down a large portion of the Swamp of Secrets in Tobytopia.
This crisis boiled over into an epique duel between Remy and Holden, which Remy would
win 2 to 1.

*The recording of the crisis and the duel is available [here](https://youtu.be/pXPVKZaFRZI).*

As a result of the Remyan victory, Remy and Holden came to the following agreement.
- Remy gets to own Remyan Mangrovia
- Remyan Mangrovia will be renamed to New Mangrovia
- Holden gets the title of Founder of New Mangrovia
- Holden gets to cleanup the mess from the crisis

Toby would later allude to not recognising this settlement between Remy and Holden,
saying that he might just invade and retake the territory for Tobytopia again. However,
Toby never acted on these threats, and New Mangrovia remains a Remyan territory.

# The Border Disorder
> Mr Tobachov, tear down that wall!

As the Glorious Leader, Remy, spoke these immortal words, the HATA worldborder
trembled in fear and retreated outwards.

## Western Hawainot Offensive
![[western_hawainot_offensive.png|Map of the Remyan advance into Western Hawainot]]
[Animated map of the invasion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rIYGpypZ0k)

The Remy Republic initiated a military operation led by General [[Fletcher Quadratic]] and swiftly invaded the western islands of the Hawainot Archipelago. Remy was then able to collect his jungle wood and cocoa beans so that he can finally begin producing his pogstries.

The military operation unfortunately was in fact very rushed in its planning and the logistics were not well prepared for. The food shipments did not arrive and Remy was forced to live off the land for the duration of the operation.

## Acquisition of Southern No
After planting his flag in Western Hawainot and acquiring his so coveted cocoa beans, Remy also claimed Southern No. This is an area of land that was originally labelled as being part of No on the first worldmap released, but tragically, in reality, lay outside the confines of the 1000 block worldborder.

[[Toby|Toby from Tobytopia]] had threatened to claim Southern No before Remy could during the days leading up to the Border Disorder, but these threats did not come to fruition.

## Jungle Island Incident

![[jungle_island_incident.png|Map of disputed jungle island]]

Remy had a dispute with Tobytopia over an island of sparse jungle to the west of Hawainot. Remy had previously intended to claim this island, but had forgotten to do so in the commotion of the Border Disorder. This island had a waterfall, and Remy had intended to turn the island into a top tier resort due to its very unique and beautiful terrain.

Unfortunately for the Glorious Leader, Toby from Tobytopia found the island and claimed it before Remy could do so. Toby planted the Tobytopian banner upon the northern side of the island, cementing his claim before Remy could get there with his own banners.

Remy attempted an amphibious assault on the island, arriving in his oak boat. Unfortunately, the Remyan military forces under General [[Fletcher Quadratic]] were tied down doing paperwork after the Western Hawainot offensive. This meant that the Remyan invasion force was extremely understaffed, with only the Glorious Leader himself participating in the invasion.

The invasion was repulsed by the defending Tobytopian forces. The Glorious Leader then made a glorious retreat back to Hawainot after his glorious defeat on the glorious jungle island.

## Claiming of the Jungle Mainland
After the glorious defeat on the jungle island, and on the suggestion of Toby, Remy rowed his boat westward again, and claimed the coastline of the large landmass further to the west of the jungle island. This landmass also had a large area of sparse jungle on it.
